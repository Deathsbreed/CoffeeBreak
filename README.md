CoffeeBreak
===========

As the title of this program suggests, its purpose is for you to take a quick coffee break.

Some of us have bosses that don't know anything about programming, and if they do they can't differenciate between a real compilation and a fake one like this; this is for them.

Simply set this running at full screen and when someone asks just tell them you're compiling ;).

### Compiling
To compile make sure you have the java compiler installed along with Apache Ant. Then run simply the following command:
```bash
$ ant
```

### Contributing
Simply send me a pull request. I always need new fake compilers, so feel free to add whatever will fool your boss!
